# Specifications Directory

This folder contains requirement documents that define what Ralph should build.

## How to Write Specs

Each spec should be a focused document covering one "topic of concern":
- A feature
- A capability
- A component
- A user flow

### Spec Structure

1. **Overview**: What is this feature/component?
2. **Jobs to Be Done**: What user problems does this solve?
3. **Requirements**: Specific, testable requirements
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's done?
5. **Non-Goals**: What is explicitly out of scope?

### Example

See `_template.md` for a starting template.

## Tips

- Be specific and testable
- Include edge cases
- Define what success looks like
- Mention dependencies on other specs
- Keep each spec focused on one concern

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive kebab-case names:
- `user-authentication.md`
- `payment-processing.md`
- `dashboard-analytics.md`
